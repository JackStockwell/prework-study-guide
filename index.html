        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
          HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is one of the main languages used in web development, it is used to create the structure of a web application.
          It is made up of elements that work together to deliver content on a website.
          <br>
          Some common elements found in websites are as follows: 
          <ul>
            <li>Text elements</li>
            <li>Imgae elements</li>
            <li>Header elements</li>
            <li>List elements</li>
          </ul>
          Some additional elements are used to divide the content on a page, they are also used to divide the page which will help browsers and other developers understand the content of your web page.
          <ul>
            <li>Meta-related elements</li>
            <li>Content division elements</li>
            <li>Semantic elements</li>
          </ul>
          Structuring the above elements together creates a frame of a webpage that allows for a user to traverse and navigate. HTML can be compared to building a house of sorts, with HTML being the foundation and framework that eventually the walls are made out of, a sturdy frame means a stronger house. Once complete CSS can be used to make it pretty and make it 'yours' while JS will explain the logic of your house, such as how you and the user will interact with the doors and windows of this house.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          There are many, many HTML tags that can be used throughout a web application, here is a small list of the main ones that will be encountered:
        <ul>
          <li>The html element is used as the start and the end of all your websites content, this includes the head element and body element.</li>
          <li>The head element containts metadata information about the webpage, the text inside will not be rendered on browsers and is for the browser itself.</li>
          <li>The body element represnets the visible content shown to the user, the content you wish for the the end user to use will be placed in here.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <h3>Git Bash</h3>
        <p>
          Git Bash is an application that allows us to navigate a computer's operating system.
          Git is a terminal that enables us to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to enter commands for the shell to execute.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Command Line Interface</h3>
        <p>
          The Command Line Interface (CLI) allows us to input text commands to execute operating system functions, such as file exploration and or creating 
          a new folder. Many years ago this would have been the default way to navigate your computer's file system but nowadays user-friendly GUIs exist, however it is an important for a developer to still be able to use this method as a way to navigate through files and run commands.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>
          GitHub is the web interface for Git Bash (Version Control) it allows multiple users to make separate changes to a program at the same time, due to GitHub being 'on the cloud' it can be done remotely without requiring a local connection to a server. 
          <br>
          GitHub is great for developers who are collaborating on a project but is also used to store code on the cloud ready to be accessed by another machine.
          <br>
          Git commands can be entered into Git, they are however not the same as Bash commands. Git commands always start with git and can be used to save and track versions of our code. Using Git commands we can create repositories, add code to them and view previous versions of our code, each stored with a unique commit.
          <br>
          A few examples of git commands can be found below:
          <ul>
            <li>git checkout main - Will switch to your main branch.</li>
            <li>git status - Shows which branch you're wroking on.</li>
            <li>git checkout -b 'name' - Creates a new branch with it's designated name, will switch to the branch after it has been made.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
