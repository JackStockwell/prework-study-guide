        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
          HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is one of the main languages used in web development, it is used to create the structure of a web application.
          It is made up of elements that work together to deliver content on a website. Some common elements found in websites are as follows: 
          <ul>
            <li>Text elements</li>
            <li>Imgae elements</li>
            <li>Header elements</li>
            <li>List elements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some additional elements are used to divide the content on a page, they are also used to divide the page which will help browsers and other developers understand the content of your web page.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Meta-related elements</li>
            <li>Content division elements</li>
            <li>Semantic elements</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          Structuring the above elements together creates a frame of a webpage that allows for a user to traverse and navigate. HTML can be compared to building a house of sorts, with HTML being the foundation and framework that eventually the walls are made out of, a sturdy frame means a stronger house. Once complete CSS can be used to make it pretty and make it 'yours' while JS will explain the logic of your house, such as how you and the user will interact with the doors and windows of this house.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          There are many, many HTML tags that can be used throughout a web application, here is a small list of the main ones that will be encountered:
        <ul>
          <li>The !DOCTYPE declaration tells the browser that it is loading a HTML document</li>
          <li>The html element is used as the start and the end of all your websites content, this includes the head element and body element.</li>
          <li>The head element containts metadata information about the webpage, the text inside will not be rendered on browsers and is for the browser itself.</li>
          <li>The meta element contains information used by the browser. More inforamtion can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">here</a></li>
          <li>The body element represnets the visible content shown to the user, the content you wish for the the end user to use will be placed in here.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles related to the website</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> is a language used by developers to show how the HTML content is displayed to users. CSS is used to define the 'style' of the website, everything from the colours of text to visual layout and organisation of the web page. This differs from HTML as it strictly handles the structure and content of the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 3 ways to use CSS to style and customise a website: inline CSS, internal CSS and external CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Inline CSS</span> uses the <code class="codeintext">&lt;style&gt;</code> attribute, it is added to elements to alter their specific appearance directly inside the HTML document. They are used to make quick changes, but have less flexibility than the other 2 options. An example below:
        </p>
      <br>
        <code class="codeblock">
          &lt;p style="color:blue;">This text is blue!&gt;
        </code>
      <br>
        <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Inline CSS</span> uses the <code class="codeintext">&lt;style&gt;</code> element in the the head element which can be used to alter the content of the entire webpage. You can define what elements, classes and IDs (selectors) that will be altered then change what properties will be altered followed by a value.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">External CSS</span> is the most common as it uses an external .css document to make changes to the webpage it is linked to. A HTML document is linked to the stylesheet in the head element using a link element.
        </p>
      <br>
        <code class="codeblock">
          &lt;link rel=”stylesheet” href=”./assets/style.css” /&gt;
        </code>
        <h3>CSS Rule</h3>
          <img src="./assets/300-css-rule.png" alt="Image of the CSS Syntax">
      <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Selector: Selects what the declarations will be applied too</li>
          <li>Declaration: Made up of a property and value, the property is what we want to apply and the value is what we are changing</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
        <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
        <p>
          All HTML elements are displayed as boxes, they have margins like a word document and we can alter how the box appears through CSS.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <h3>Git Bash</h3>
        <p>
          Git Bash is an application that allows us to navigate a computer's operating system.
          Git is a terminal that enables us to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to enter commands for the shell to execute.
        </p>
        <h3>Command Line Interface</h3>
        <p>
          The Command Line Interface (CLI) allows us to input text commands to execute operating system functions, such as file exploration and or creating 
          a new folder. Many years ago this would have been the default way to navigate your computer's file system but nowadays user-friendly GUIs exist, however it is an important for a developer to still be able to use this method as a way to navigate through files and run commands.
        </p>
        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>
          GitHub is the web interface for Git Bash (Version Control) it allows multiple users to make separate changes to a program at the same time, due to GitHub being 'on the cloud' it can be done remotely without requiring a local connection to a server. GitHub is great for developers who are collaborating on a project but is also used to store code on the cloud ready to be accessed by another machine.
          <br>
          <h4>GitHub Terms</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>All projects on GitHub are called repositories. It's a folder that has all your assets and previous versions of your project.</li>
            <li>A Branch is a workspace where you can make changes that don't affect the live site. You create a new branch for your work, naming it correctly such as a date and what you're working on.</li>
            <li>All files on GitHub are formatted in Markdown. It is used as a way to write for the web using plain text as it easily converts to HTML. Markdown files end with .md extension.</li>
            <li>Once you have made changes in the Markdown, you will Commit the changes, saving a new version of the file you are working on. Whenever you change, edit or delete in a file, you're making a commit. All commits you make will be saved to the branch you're working on.</li>
            <li>Pull requests is the act of asking for changes made to a branch to be merged into another branch, this allows others users to see, discuss and review the work that was made.</li>
            <li>After the pull request is approved. The commit will be Merged from one branch to another then deployed on the live site.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Git Commands</h4>
        <p>
          Git commands can be entered into Git, they are however not the same as Bash commands. Git commands always start with git and can be used to save and track versions of our code. Using Git commands we can create repositories, add code to them and view previous versions of our code, each stored with a unique commit.
          <br>
          An example of the comnmands used in the Git flow:
          <ul>
            <li>git checkout main - Will switch to your main branch, main can be subsidised for other branches.</li>
            <li>git status - Shows which branch you're wroking on.</li>
            <li>git checkout -b 'BranchName' - Creates a new branch with it's designated name, will switch to the branch after it has been made.</li>
            <li>git add -A - Add all the files in the working branch to be staged.</li>
            <li>git commit -m "added extra content to HTML file" - Used to commit our staged files to be sent to our repository, the -m tag adds a comment so everyone knows what you're changing/adding.</li>
            <li>git pull origin main - Pulls the base branch into your feature branch to ensure it is sync, this is important incase others have made changes to the base branch that are not in your feature branch.</li>
            <li>git push origin 'BranchName' - This will push our changes to the GitHub repo. The rest of the work is done via GitHub website.</li>
            <li>The rest will be guided on GitHub a guide can be seen <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request?tool=webui">here</a></a></li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold">JavaScript</span> is a critical tool to web development, it adds interactivity, effects, data communication and more. Re-visiting the house analogy is what allows us to open the doors of the house, turning the lights on and off etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, offering a wide range of functionality with little effort involved. These include:
          <ul>
            <li>APIs are built into web browsers, they provide additional functionality such as generating 3D graphics, providing audio samples and the ability to dynamically create HTML and CSS.</li>
            <li>Third party APIs allow you to incorporate functionality from other sites like YouTube or Facebook.</li>
            <li>Third party frameworks and libraries that can be used in your own HTML code to speed up the process of building your website.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>Operators</h3>
            <p>
              Operators is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). 
            </p>
            <h3>Conditionals</h3>
            <p>
              Conditionals are used to test if an expression returns true or not. A common form of conditionals is the <code class=”codeintext”>if…else</code> statement.
            <code>
              <pre>
      let iceCream = "chocolate";
      if (iceCream === "chocolate") {
       alert("Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!");
      } else {
       alert("Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite…");
      }
              </pre>
            </code>          
            </p>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>
          Are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to re-use. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. Saving us having to re-write our code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions may look similar to a variable, but if it is followed by parentheses ( ) is more likely to be a function. We fill the parentheses with Arguments, which is a value passed as input to a function.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript allows us to create our own functions. The below will create a multiply function by taking two numbers as arguments.
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
      function multiply(num1, num2) {
      let result = num1 * num2;
       return result;
      }            
          </pre>
          </code>
        <p>
          In order for a function to work it must be called upon in the code. Remembering that the control flow of JavaScript is top to bottom, so the order will matter. It called upon by writing the function in the such as <code class="codeintext">multiply (7, 8);</code>
        </p>
        <h3>For Loop</h3>
          <p>
            A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task. The computer will go through each of the values in the array, which when paired with another statement like a conditional if statement it will stop the loop by running the code associated with the if statement. A for loop begins with a three-part conditional statement followed by a code that will be executed once the loop is complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The loop needs a starting point and a condition, this is done by setting the var x =0 meaning it will start on the first index of our array, the second statement is the condition in which as long as x is less than the length of the array length it will continue to run; this is shown with x < myVariable.length;. The final statement is what we tell the array to iterate over each item, since an array's index is +1 along every step, x++ is a quick and simple way to tell the loop to x+1.
          </p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Contro flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the keyword fucntion followed by the name of our function<code class="codeintext">function myFunction()</code> then below we give our function a block of code that it will execute when called upon</li>
