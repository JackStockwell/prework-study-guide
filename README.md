# prework-study-guide

## Description

A study guide for pre-work students for a coding bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

The motivation behind the project was to use the skills gained from pre-work to create a basic website on notes I learned throughout my Prework. It allows my notes to be displayed in an easy to read fashion; allowed me to practice my knowledge in a real life setting; helped me solve problems that arose from the development. 

I learned valueable information on how to create a project from scratch and the developement pipeline. The sum of the website is only a fraction of what I learnt.
